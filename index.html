            <header class="header_1"><h2>I. Our beginning - the end of Antonines</h2></header>
            <p>After Marcus Aurelius' despotic act, commending his son Commodus to assume the empire, the enlightened era from Flavians and Antonines almost faced its destruction as though it was just not more than a dream.</p>
            <p>Commodus was totally opposite of his father, he might be a good soldier but was a barbarian man with the most inappropriate behavior for an Augustus, he was hated for everyone, since the Senate and the people to their courtiers and lover. His fourteenth years reign was a succession of three dictatorships lead by Perenis, Cleandro and Leto, the first and the third was from praetorian guard and the second was a chamberlain, meanwhile Commodus freed itself in gladiator games and any other debauchery.</p>
            <p>This craziness needed to be stopped and was done by his lover Marcia, with poison, and by a gladiator who was called to the palace to fight with the Emperor. It was a brutal death, being betrayed by his own passion</p>
            <br>
            <p>A new blood run will occur after Commodus death in 192 anno domini, not quite different from what happened after the Emperor Nero death but even more aggressive. Pertinax assumed the government between January and March of 193 being raised by the praetorian guard against your will, a military discipline enthusiast began a reasonable and restorative reign but was brutally murdered by the same praetorian guard who put him there.</p>
            <p>The guards were just acting as mercenaries, the worst ones! The jurisconsult Dídio Juliano saw this praetorian guard's desire and used his wealth to buy them and take the empire, the soldiers praise and defend him while he gives them a bunch of drachmas, his government was ended by a murderer in July. Afterwards several legions with their generals claimed the empire for themselves, the Sirian’s raised Pescennius Niger, Britain's Albino and the Danubian’s Septimus Severus, the last one was victorious and entered Rome leading his troops.</p>

            <header class="header_2"><h2>II. Septimus Severus rules the disorder</h2></header>
            <p>Septimus Severus was a brave and moderate african with an energetic character, he was the man who vengenced Pertinax, killing the haughty Dídio Juliano and executing the traitors. The first things that he did when assumed power was killing a bunch of senators and aristocrats to consolidate his reign, having a government such as oriental despotism.</p>
            <p>The new emperor was a great commander with several success military campaigns, won territory from Orient to Occident: wracking Byzantium; conquest Ctesifonte, the Parta capital; annexed Mesopotamia, marched in Gaul and in his last adventure in Britain against the Scotis he died in Iork on 211. During his reign the militaries proeminence grew even more and this fact just sank the Romanitie deeper, the legions were full of foreigners such as Germans, Syrians, Africans, Arabs and so on. This miscellaneous inside the legions destroyed the old sense of Romanitie and they were there just for the war and loot, men completely corrupted and degenerated.</p>
            <p>Septimius made the same mistake of Marcus Aurelius, commending his own sons as heir of the reign, Geta and Caracalla. The last paternal advice was very materialist and immoral, showing the decadence of this time: “Fill the soldier's bag and the other things don’t matter at all.”</p>

            <header class="header_3"><h2>III. Severus dynasty trembles</h2></header>
            <p>Caracalla was given the name of Antoninus by his father, a way that the emperor found to show the Senate, legions and people the prestige of his son, but all the effort was null, his son after your death will show a true tyrannical reign and an inhuman character. Caracalla begins with a bloodbath killing your own brother Geta and all their partisans, afterwards flooding the troops with riches and privileges, then indulging in all the demagogic acts and gladiator’s games and challenges among beasts.</p>
            <p>He delegates his mom, Julia Domna, the charge of government and administration. When Caracalla inebriates with his own passions, he desires to be a great conqueror, not like his father or Cesar, but the greatest like Alexander the Great of Macedon! Then he starts the march to Asia, but in the way the soldiers revolt and brutally kill him, there the troops raise Macrinus as emperor.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Macrinus had an ephemeral reign, the Severus family was already planning to put someone as Augustus. Julia Mesa, sister of Septimius’ widow, starts to vehiculate the name of Varius Avitus who was son of his daughter Julia Semias and priest of Baal, bonded with the name of Antoninus and as true son of Caracalla, won Macrinus and began his peculiar and controversial reign.</p>
            <p>The yount adopted a new name according to his god, Elagabalus which means “creator god”, his triumphal entrance in Rome was full of mystic symbolism, the face painted full of gems and the raiment with purple and gold announces an idol. During four years Elagabalus surrenders for all debauchery, not for itself as related with other emperors, but in a mystical and ceremonial way which drove all the present on a frenzy. These awful events promoted by the emperor even shocked the religious and sexual morality of his time, in 222 the praetorians dilacerate Elagabalus and his mother, then a historic act was repeated with their corpses, they were dragged on the roads till the be tossing on Tiber river…</p>
            <br>
            <p>Quickly Julia Mamaea, sister of Julia Semias, proclaims his son Alexander Severus with the help of her mother and they gatter success, the man was acclaimed by the praetorian and the people believed him.</p>

            <header class="header_4"><h2>IV. Alexander Severus continues</h2></header>
            <p>Considering the whole background, Alexander was a man among few ones, he had a balance between intelligence and love for arts but didn't lose anything in the science of war, working with zealous, long-suffering and justice in their reign. He always said had more problems with their men than win their enemies, with his mother and Ulpian, an important legist, as advisors he started a bunch of reforms trying to change this and other problems in the empire.</p>
            <p>He worked to restore the public finances, sanitation the civic/morale and improve the agriculture and industry, attempts to establish the power of the Senate and aristocrats and reduce the military influence on politics. Naturally, reform time with tranquility and equity are followed by constructions everywhere in the territory: bridges, aqueducts, roads and bathhouses are examples. It seems the good Anotine’s days returned with him.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Not so far the war comes with the Persian Ardashir invading mesopotamia wanting territories in Syria and Asia Minor, Alexander goes there and back with the victory. Meanwhile in the Gaul region some barbarian tribes saw the Rhine and Danubius unguarded then started an invasion, there the emperor went. In the battlefield he commits a blunder, advised by his mother, Alexander takes to the generals table not a battle plan but a peace treaty bribing the barbarians and this didn’t take so long to form a insurgency, then the legions declare Maximinio as emperor and invaded the tend of Alexander where was his mother too and killed both.</p>
            <p>In 235 the Severus dynasty ended and the military anarchy was established as never seen before.</p>

            <header class="header_5"><h2>V. The military anarchy breakdown</h2></header>
            <p>The new emperor Maximinus was a tyrant, demanding high taxes from Rome just for endless battles in the western front and to enrich his mercenaries. As usual in the records of history, the Africans rose an emperor for themselves, Gordianus I who annexed the title for his son Gordianus II due to his advanced age. In 238 both perished by the Maximinus’ men.</p>
            <p>Then the Senate tries to use his recent reformed power by Alexander Severus electing two emperors, Maximus and Balbinus, the first goes face Maximinus who was murdered by his own troops in the process and, Maximus returning to Rome, both the Senate’s emperors was murdered by the insane praetorian guard. The riot puts Georgianus III in rule of the empire, the youngest emperor made a great reign despite the circumstances of anarchy and invasions, he defended from the Persians and reconquered some territories including the whole Mesopotamia. But his destiny wasn’t different from the others, in 244 the guards murdered him.</p>
            <p>The praetorians’ prefect Philip the Arab assumed the empire, afraid of the government instabilities he made a shameless decision firming a peace treaty with Shapur, giving up the territories of Mesopotamia and maybe Armenia, being the first governor to withdraw territories in a treaty. In 249 Decius killed him and took the control, but this man had a short reign of two years dying in battle against the Goths, the next two emperors didn't have more luck than their predecessor, Gallus and Aemilianus died in the same year of 253 by the troops' madness.
            </p>
            <p>Valerian assumed power for more time than the others, but all these instabilities could be seen outside by the empire’s enemy and they started a huge invasion, all the barbarians from the west flooded Roman Europe and in the east the Scythians and Persians invaded the roman dominations. The emperor, losing a battle against the Persians, was captured, made a slave for a time and ripped out his skin as a trophy in 261. Gallienus, his son, took the reign with a cultural and artistic reforms bias, he was a good administrator and a brave governor but his end was not different than many others, being murdered by the soldiers in 268. Claudius II took his place and made good campaigns against the invaders, but his destiny was faded by a disease, dying in 270.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This period was full of instabilities for the Roman Empire: invasions from the barbarians and enemy reigns, political disorder, troops’ rebellion and internal revolts almost wracked the whole empire and put an end in his history. This time the end was so near that the empire was divided by other rulers in independent areas and there were so many usurpers that they were called the Thirty Tyrants, despite the great number of them and the ephemeral existence of the most, I’ll approach the two most iconic and important.</p>
            <p>The Gallic Empire with Postumus in 260 the whole roman dominances of Gaul and Germania was his and after Hispania and Britannia integrated this new empire. Odaenathus was the king who successfully defended the Persians and them declaring independence from Rome, in the same time of Gallic Empire roses the Palmyrene Empire, after your death his spouse Zenobia assumed the reign as regent and expanded the empire’s domain even to Egypt, she was a great ruler of your time. The Palmyrene Empire was really big, dominating Syria, Cilicia, Arabia, Cappadocia and Armenia.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In this whole sea of circumstances, the giant waves of catastrophes are followed by the impetuous winds of the bad fortunes, the colossal ship of Rome now is just a papel boat in the chaotic nature of history. It just needs a last captain, to right the watercraft or to finally bump it into the rocks.</p>

            <header class="header_6"><h2>VI. Iliric, the old Roman specter</h2></header>
            <p>The Roman economy faces a real crisis of manpower in farm and industry and is accompanied with the oriental cults who quickly advance inside the society, breaking all the old morals and behavior. Domitius Aurelianus was the name that Rome needed, in 270 after the death of Claudius II he assumed the power, a disciplined and severe leader who subjugated the empire’s enemies, one by one the internal and the external.</p>
            <p>He made several conquests against the barbarians and ordered the building of several fortifications in Rome and other Italian cities, then he launched a campaign to the East against the Palmyrene Empire. First Probo, a man at arms of the emperor, reconquest the Egypt and after Aurelianus cross the Dardanelles Strait and strike Zenobia’s troops in Ephesus, in 272 the emperor made a glorious entrance in Rome showing his special prisoner in chains of gold and giving to empire the restoration of it’s lands. Now it’s time for the Gallic Empire, winning Tetricus, the successor of Postumus, in 274 all the territories are back to Roman domain again, and Aurelianus was justly called <em>restitutor orbis</em>, the world restorer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Your tremendous success came to his mind and consumed him, he wanted to be adored as a god but the only god, for this he established the union of all the religions in one, the Sun. Aurelianus was the Sun to be adored, such in an Egyptian cult. Aurelianus was the Sun to be adored, such in an Egyptian cult. Not late, in 275 going to the East against the Persians, your officials betray him and he dies for the troops.</p>
            <p>Once again the fury of the soldiers are incited and Rome back to the shadow path of uncertainties, but even they tremble their legs of fear or hangover to go back in a endless bloodbath.</p>

<!-- 
    1.  You can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
    2.  Within the #main-doc element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of five
    3.  The first element within each .main-section should be a header element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
    4.  Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java")
    5.  The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each)
    6.  The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)
    7.  The .main-section elements should contain at least five li items total (not each)
    8.  You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar"
    9.  The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation
    10. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section
    11. The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar
    12. Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
    13. When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)
    14. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
    15. Your technical documentation should use at least one media query
